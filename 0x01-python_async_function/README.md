# 0x01. Python - Async

This project focuses on learning the basics of asynchronous programming using `asyncio` and `random` modules in Python. The tasks involve writing asynchronous functions and measuring their performance.

## Tasks
- 0: Basic asynchronous function using random delay
- 1: Running multiple asynchronous functions concurrently
- 2: Measuring runtime of asynchronous operations
- 3: Creating tasks
- 4: Handling multiple tasks concurrently

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `pycodestyle` compliant (2.5.x)
